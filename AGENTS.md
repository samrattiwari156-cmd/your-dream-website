> that are already pushed — as it rewrites history on Lovable's side and the

>
> Commits you push to the connected branch sync back to Lovable and show up in
> the editor, so keep the branch in a working state.

## Website architecture
- Keep shared navigation and footer in the root layout, with one content route per reference page, so navigation and page metadata stay consistent.
- Keep media URLs in a shared assets module backed by Lovable asset pointers so photographs and the supplied logo can be reused across pages.
